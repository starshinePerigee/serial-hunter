workflow:

on init, we create a SerialPort object for every serial port

serial ports can also be added manually

each operation runs on every serial port

you can always filter by the results of an operation (or the inverse) - and there's a flag on each command
to immediately apply that filter


drop / add / filter / clear / undo / reset / save / load / get all
set parameters (on one, all, or active)

command target payload

active (default)
! inverts
p: previous
c: current
a: all
r: regex
s: specific

all can use quotes (or not!)


features:

run commands from a file
